# Euston Leisure Messaging System
Coursework for SET09402 Software Engineering 3

This is the coursework I submitted for my third year Software Engineering module - I received a grade (with merit) of 80.5%

The ask was to design and build a prototype messaging system for a chain of sports centres. The prototype had to validate, sanitise and categorise incoming messages of varying types; texts, emails and tweets.

Alongside the prototype we were asked to produce a report including full requirements analysis, system design justification, class diagram, test plan and predictions for future system maintenance and evolution.

Here's my report:

Here's a demo of the final prototype:
